A fully automatic camera and hand eye calibration 

This is two add-ons for this camera calibration toolbox for Matlab. The first part covers a fully automatic calibration procedure and the second covers the calibration of the camera to a robot-arm or an external marker (known as Hand-Eye claibration). 

Unluckily the original documentation got lost, so I refer the reader/user to the source code

Entry points are:

* autocalib.m
* handeye.m
